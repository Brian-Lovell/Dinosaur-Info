Hello Student,
Impressive job especially creating the three compare methods, this is quite some great work you have done to put up a submission of this quality. It simply depicts that you have put in so much time to make this project a success. Keep doing the good work and good luck in your future projects.

Check out this link on some insights on how to use Javascript prototypes to implement methods
All the Best!!
Regards!!

### Code Functionality & UI
No error messages should be logged to console. Console should also be void of any console.log statements.

There should be a click event where form should no longer be visible on the UI once the button is clicked.

The Dom should contain a grid of 9 tiles with the following conditions:

7 Dinosaurs with species, image, and random fact displayed
1 Human located in the middle with name from input displayed in place of species and no fact.
1 Bird with species, image, and the fact, “All birds are Dinosaurs.”
Refreshing the screen and entering new data should reveal different facts.
### Code Quality
Ensure that the code follows Udacity javascript coding standards and be linted and commented.

All good now
Code should minimize code repetition and be easy to read and easy to maintain (DRY).

It should name variables descriptively, and optionally use comments as needed to document code functionality. Functions should include comments to describe the function. Functions should be declared before they are called. Class (regardless of how it is created) should be easy to recognize and commented as such.

### OOJS Concepts
There should be at least 1 class/function for creating new objects. There should be 9 objects created.

Student should complete the human object with data pulled from the form when “Compare me” is clicked.

There should be at least 3 methods which compare dino data to the user data from the DOM. Student may choose to add additional options to the form to compare alternative items such as location, length, or time period.

:white_check_mark:
Great work creating three methods to compare the human data to dino data.

Here is a link for more insights on classes and methods
Iterate through objects to create tiles with species, image, and fact that are appended to DOM. Conditionally display appropriate information for Human, Bird and Dinosaurs.
